# CoSiT an Agent-Based Tool

CoSiT is an educational, simple, interactive, participative and generalist computer tool that can help in the fight against infectious diseases. This tool named CoSiT (Covid-19 Simulation Tools) is based on the GAMA (GIS and Agent-based Modelling Architecture) modeling and simulation platform and follows a set of principles and requirements as follows :

- It is first and foremost an educational tool for training and raising awareness on the importance of respecting barrier measures in the fight against the spread of Covid-19.
- It is also and above all an interactive and participative tool.
- It is based on the so-called non-pharmaceutical measures prescribed as part of the fight against Covid-19, to produce simulations of our daily lives and to visualize the results obtained in an interface provided for this purpose.
- It is based on a detailed and realistic representation of the impact of barrier measures in controlling the spread of Covid-19 in the environment of our choice.
- It is generic, flexible and applicable to any case study.
- It is open and modular enough to support interdisciplinary cooperation. 
- It provides easy access to small-scale training, experimentation and sensitization, making it easy to explore its parameters.
